# 2D-CAR-GAME
Building a simple 2D game assignment under 3D Graphics module University of Westminster.


### Game Intro

The car waits at the red gate until the user presses an arrow key to move the car. The car shall turn/rotate to the appropriate orientation depending on which key will be pressed next.
The user moves the car around the hazards and out of the green gate. Once the car has reached the green gate the game ends. If the car collides with a square then 10 points are deducted from the score.
The score starts from 50. A successful game will lead to the award of 50 points (if no hazards are hit). Once the car has exited the green gate the hazard blocks should re-spawn in different positions.
The score will accumulate until the application is closed.

```
